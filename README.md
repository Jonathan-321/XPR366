# XPR366
Explorer366

Xpr366 is a software platform that utilizes robots to collect enough sensor data that can be used to understand the health of infrastructures and make informed decisions. With this project , we explore some techniques used to create digital twins of physical objects using technologies such as photogrammetry , point clouds and other 3D scanning techniques. 

The primary goal with this is to build a small scale data collection system for a few types of sensors. This shall give us insights into data ingestion and storage. The second thing will be creating a basic dashboard that displays raw sensor data. This will also help in understanding the visualization requirements and UI challenges. To have this work together , we’ll have a simple API that allows fetching raw sensor data that lays the groundwork for more complex API functionalities. 

Initially, we’re going to focus on creating a digital twin for a single, simple asset. This will help in understanding the asset digitization process before scaling to more complex assets. Finally, we’ll implement a simple anomaly detection algorithm on a single data stream, allowing us to learn and dive deep into the data processing and analysis requirements.

A company called Arrival3D creating a sort of digital twin using laser scanning would be an example of what we’re typically trying to achieve but on a large scale and with other different technologies. All this could be used to accelerate the mission and vision of using AI and Robotics to revolutionize the automation of work in complex and dangerous environments.
